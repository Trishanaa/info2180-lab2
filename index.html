                <p>My name is Trishana, and I'm a 20-year-old university student in my second year, working towards my goal of becoming a cybersecurity analyst. 
                    I've always been fascinated by technology and the idea of protecting systems from cyber threats. 
                    When I'm not studying, I love to read books that take me on new adventures and unwind with action movies that keep me hooked. 
                    This semester, I'm really excited to dive into web development. I can't wait to expand my skills and learn how to build and secure websites, 
                    which I know will be an important part of my future in cybersecurity.</p>

                <p>Alongside my academic journey, I’m constantly seeking out new challenges that help me grow, both personally and professionally. 
                    I believe that being a cybersecurity analyst isn’t just about protecting networks; it’s about understanding how everything works, from code to user behavior. 
                    That’s why I’m particularly thrilled to start web development this semester—it feels like another step toward becoming a more well-rounded tech professional. I’ve always enjoyed solving complex problems, and web development will give me a hands-on experience with the digital spaces I’ll eventually be defending. 
                    It’s exciting to think about how these skills will come together to shape my future career.</p>
